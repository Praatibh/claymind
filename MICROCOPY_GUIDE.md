# Education for the Age of AI - UX Writing & Microcopy Guide

## 🎯 Voice & Tone Guide

### Core Voice Traits

1. **Curious** - We ask questions, explore ideas, and model wonder about AI and technology
2. **Calm** - We speak clearly and never rush; even errors are chances to learn
3. **Encouraging** - We notice effort, growth, and trying again—not just "being right"
4. **Real** - We sound like a thoughtful teacher, not a robot or marketing site
5. **Respectful** - We trust kids to understand real concepts; we don't talk down or oversimplify incorrectly

### Tone Rules by Context

| "Let's get started" | "Let me show you around" / "Let's try this together" | Vary sentence structure; sound human |
| "An error has occurred" | "Hmm, something didn't work. Let's try that again." | Name what happened; offer next step |
| "Congratulations!" | "You did it!" / "Nice work!" | Be specific to what they actually accomplished |
| "Invalid password" | "That password didn't match. Want to try again?" | Explain clearly; offer path forward |

### Gamification & Rewards

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "Unlock achievements" | "Earn badges as you learn" | Use concrete, kid-friendly language |

| "Operation failed" | "That didn't work. Let's try again." | Acknowledge, then path forward |
| "Access denied" | "This unlocks at Level 5. You're Level 3—keep learning!" | Context + encouragement |

### Parent/Teacher Communication

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "Track learner metrics" | "See what they're learning" | Warm, not clinical |
| "Performance indicators" | "How they're doing" | Simple, clear |
| "Data visualization dashboard" | "Your child's progress" | Human-centered, not tool-centered |

## 📝 Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

**Do:**
- Keep sentences under 15 words when possible
- Use active voice ("You earned this" not "This was earned by you")
- Start with the most important information
- Use "you" and "your" to make it personal
- Vary sentence beginnings (don't always start with "You...")

**Don't:**
- Use passive constructions
- Bury the main point in the middle
- Use complex subordinate clauses
- String together long lists in one sentence

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Upon successful completion of the mission, achievements will be unlocked for you."
- ✅ "You completed the mission! Here's what you unlocked."

---

### Word Choice

**Use these words:**
- Learn, explore, discover, build, create, try
- Curious, careful, thoughtful, creative
- Real, actual, everyday, true
- Help, guide, show, explain
- Safe, protected, private

**Avoid these words:**
- Leverage, utilize, optimize, maximize
- Synergy, ecosystem, platform, solution
- Master, dominate, crush, destroy
- Always, never, must, have to (unless safety)
- Revolutionary, amazing, incredible (overused superlatives)

---

### Numbers & Data

**Do:**
- Round to friendly numbers ("about 15 minutes" not "14.7 minutes")
- Use digits for numbers 10+ (10, 25, 100)
- Spell out numbers under 10 (three, seven, nine)
- Show progress as fractions when helpful (7 out of 10)
- Use percentages sparingly

**Examples:**
- ✅ "About 15 minutes"
- ✅ "7 out of 8 correct"
- ✅ "You're Level 5"
- ❌ "87.5% accuracy rate"
- ❌ "Approximately 14 minutes, 32 seconds"

---

### Punctuation & Formatting

**Do:**
- Use contractions (you're, we'll, don't) for warmth
- End most messages with periods, not exclamation marks
- Use exclamation marks only for real achievements
- Use question marks for genuine questions
- Use em dashes (—) for emphasis or clarification

**Don't:**
- Overuse exclamation marks!!!!!
- Use ellipses to create suspense...
- Use ALL CAPS except for acronyms
- Use semicolons (too formal for kids)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "You did it! That was tricky."
- ✅ "Hmm, that didn't work. Want to try again?"
- ❌ "Great job!!! You're amazing!!!"
- ❌ "Loading... please wait..."

## 🎨 Clai (AI Guide) Voice

### When Clai Speaks

Clai should speak:
- At key transitions (starting a mission, completing a lesson)
- When giving hints or help
- When celebrating achievements
- When explaining something new
- When reassuring after errors

Clai should NOT speak:
- On every single screen (too much)
- For basic navigation ("Click here!")
- For obvious actions
- In a way that interrupts the user

### Clai's Personality

**Characteristics:**
- Warm but not overly enthusiastic
- Curious and encouraging
- Patient and specific with help
- Celebrates effort, not just results
- Honest about difficulty

**Clai's typical phrases:**
- "Let me show you..."
- "Here's something cool..."
- "This one's tricky, but..."
- "You're getting better at..."
- "That's the kind of thinking that..."
- "I'll help you with this."

**Avoid these for Clai:**
- "OMG you're so amazing!!!"
- "Let's crush this challenge!"
- "Get ready to level up your skills!"
- "Are you ready for an epic adventure?!?!"

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Clai:**
> "You spotted the fake image! That's the kind of careful thinking AI experts use."

> "This one's tricky. Here's a hint: look at the fingers in the photo."

> "You're learning fast! Here's what you unlocked."

❌ **Bad Clai:**
> "OMG!!! You're absolutely crushing it, superstar!!!"

> "Get ready for an EPIC journey into the world of AI!!!"

> "Let's unlock your full potential and maximize your learning!"

## 🧒 Age-Appropriate Language (7-14 years)

### Vocabulary Guidelines

**7-9 years:**
- Very simple, concrete words
- Short sentences (under 12 words)
- Everyday examples (school, games, friends)
- Minimal technical terms (explain when used)

**10-12 years:**
- Can handle more abstract concepts
- Sentences up to 15 words
- Can understand "bias," "algorithm," "data"
- Still need examples and visuals

**13-14 years:**
- More sophisticated vocabulary okay
- Can handle nuance and complexity
- Respect their growing independence
- Don't condescend

**Universal (all ages):**
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use analogies to familiar concepts
- Break complex ideas into steps
- Assume intelligence, not prior knowledge

---

### Examples by Age Group

**Explaining "Algorithm" (age-appropriate variations):**

**7-9 years:**
> "An algorithm is like a recipe. It's step-by-step instructions that tell a computer what to do."

**10-12 years:**
> "An algorithm is a set of rules that tells AI how to solve a problem, like how to recommend videos you might like."

**13-14 years:**
> "An algorithm is a process that AI uses to make decisions. For example, the algorithm in your video app looks at what you've watched before and suggests similar content."

---

## 💬 Common UI Patterns

### Buttons

**Primary actions (what we want them to do):**
- "Next" (not "Continue" or "Proceed")
- "Start mission"
- "Try again"
- "Let's go"
- "Got it"

**Secondary actions (alternative paths):**
- "Back to map"
- "Change this later"
- "Skip for now"
- "Need help?"

**Destructive actions (require confirmation):**
- "Delete" (after "Are you sure?")
- "Reset progress"
- "Sign out"

### Form Fields

**Labels should:**
- Be short and clear
- Explain what to enter
- Avoid jargon

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Your email"
- ✅ "Create a password"
- ✅ "Your first name"
- ❌ "Email address (required)"
- ❌ "Password (8+ chars, 1 number)"

**Placeholders should:**
- Give examples, not instructions
- Use real-looking sample data
- Not repeat the label

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Like Emma, or Jamal"
- ✅ "alex@email.com"
- ❌ "Enter your name here"
- ❌ "Your email address"

**Helper text should:**
- Appear below the field
- Give specific guidance
- Explain requirements clearly

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We'll send a confirmation email to this address."
- ✅ "At least 8 characters with one number."
- ❌ "Invalid format."

### Error Messages

**Always include:**
1. What went wrong (clear, specific)
2. What to do next (actionable)
3. Optional: Why it matters or reassurance

**Template:**
> [What happened]. [What to do]. [Optional reassurance]

**Examples:**

✅ **Good errors:**
> "That password didn't match. Try typing it again, or tap 'Need help?' below."

> "We don't have an account with that email yet. Want to create one?"

> "Hmm, something didn't work. Try refreshing the page. Your progress is saved."

❌ **Bad errors:**
> "Error: Invalid credentials."

> "Authentication failed."

> "An unexpected error occurred."

### Loading States

**Keep it simple:**
- "Loading..."
- "Loading your lesson..."
- "Getting everything ready..."

**Don't:**
- Show fake percentages
- Make jokes during long loads
- Use technical jargon

**Add warmth with Clai (optional):**
> Loading your lesson...
>
> 🤖 Clai: "Getting everything ready for you."

### Empty States

**Template:**
1. Friendly icon
2. Short headline explaining why it's empty
3. One sentence of context
4. Clear action to take

**Example:**
> 📚 No missions started yet
>
> You haven't started any missions. Pick one from the map that sounds interesting!
>
> [Explore map]

## 🎓 Learning & Pedagogy Voice

### Feedback on Correct Answers

**Do:**
- Name what they did right
- Explain *why* it's correct
- Connect to broader concept
- Praise the skill, not just the result

**Examples:**

✅ **Good feedback:**
> "That's it! Image B is AI-generated. Notice the extra finger? AI tools still make mistakes like that. That's the kind of careful looking that helps you spot fakes."

> "You got it! That's pattern recognition—a key AI skill."

❌ **Bad feedback:**
> "Correct!"

> "You're so smart!"

> "Great job! You're amazing!"

### Feedback on Wrong Answers

**Do:**
- Stay calm and encouraging
- Give specific guidance (not just "wrong")
- Offer choice (try again or see answer)
- Acknowledge difficulty if it's hard
- Award some XP for effort

**Examples:**

✅ **Good feedback:**
> "Not quite. Image A is actually the real photo. Let's look again at Image B—count the fingers carefully."
>
> 🤖 Clai: "This one's tricky. Want to try again, or see the answer?"

❌ **Bad feedback:**
> "Wrong. Try again."

> "Incorrect. The answer is B."

> "Sorry, that's not right."

### Hints

**Do:**
- Give specific direction without giving away answer
- Explain *where* to look, not *what* to see
- Teach strategy, not just the answer

**Examples:**

✅ **Good hints:**
> "AI sometimes struggles with hands. Count the fingers—do both images look right?"

> "Look closely at the shadows. Do they all point the same direction?"

❌ **Bad hints:**
> "Look more carefully."

> "The answer is in the image."

> "Think about what you learned."

## 🏆 Rewards & Motivation

### XP & Levels

**When showing XP gains:**
- Be brief and visual
- Show the number clearly
- Don't interrupt flow

**Examples:**
- ✅ "+50 XP" (brief notification)
- ✅ "You earned 150 XP!"
- ❌ "Congratulations! You have been awarded 50 experience points!"

**When leveling up:**
- Celebrate the moment
- Name what they unlocked (concrete)
- Praise the journey, not just the milestone

**Example:**
> 🎉 Level up!
>
> You're now Level 5: AI Explorer
>
> 🤖 Clai: "You're learning fast! Here's what you unlocked:"
>
> ✓ New missions about AI and creativity
> ✓ 5 new avatar accessories
> ✓ Progress dashboard

### Badges

**Badge names should:**
- Be concrete and descriptive
- Sound like achievements, not marketing
- Make sense to a 10-year-old

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Fact Checker" (for deepfake mission)
- ✅ "7-Day Streak"
- ✅ "Problem Solver"
- ❌ "AI Innovator Elite"
- ❌ "Learning Champion Extraordinaire"

**Badge descriptions should:**
- Explain what they did to earn it
- Connect to the skill they demonstrated

**Example:**
> 🏅 Fact Checker
>
> You completed the "Spot the Fake" mission and learned to think critically about images.
>
> 🤖 Clai: "You earned this by paying attention to details. That's real learning."

### Streaks

**Do:**
- Celebrate milestones
- Make it optional (no pressure)
- Reassure when streak breaks

**Examples:**

✅ **Gentle streak reminder:**
> 🔥 7-day streak!
>
> You've visited 7 days in a row. Come back tomorrow to keep it going.
>
> (No pressure—just letting you know!)

✅ **Streak broken, empathetic:**
> Your 24-day streak ended, but that was amazing progress! Want to start fresh and try for 25 days?

❌ **Pressure-inducing:**
> "Don't lose your streak! Only 2 hours left!"

> "Your streak is about to break! Log in now!"

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent/Teacher Communication

### Dashboard Language

**Do:**
- Use professional but warm tone
- Explain metrics in plain language
- Focus on growth and learning, not scores
- Reassure about safety and privacy
- Suggest conversation starters

**Don't:**
- Use corporate jargon
- Overwhelming data visualization
- Make judgments about the child
- Hide privacy practices

**Examples:**

>
> **Learning progress**
> - Current level: 5 (AI Explorer)
> - Time spent this week: 2 hours 15 min
> - Topics exploring: How AI thinks (80%), AI and fairness (40%)
>
> **Conversation starter:**
> "I saw you're learning about AI fairness. Can you show me an example of when AI might be unfair?"

❌ **Bad parent dashboard:**
> Learner Performance Metrics
>
> - Engagement rate: 87%
> - Competency score: 4.2/5
> - Achievement unlocks: 12
> - Platform utilization: High

### Privacy & Safety

**Do:**
- Be direct and honest
- Explain in plain language
- List specific protections
- Give parents control

**Example:**
> How we protect your child
>
> ✓ COPPA compliant
>    We follow federal rules for children's online privacy. We never sell or share personal data.
>
> ✓ No ads, ever
>    This is a learning space, not a marketplace.
>
> ✓ You're in control
>    You can pause their account, review progress, or delete all data anytime.
